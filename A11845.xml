            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <item>1. The power of a ſound ſpirit againſt all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall calamity, uttered in theſe words, <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>Concerning the firſt part, I ſhall enquire into theſe things:</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:27100:6"/>
            <p>Firſt, what is meant by the infirmity of man?</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man which doth and will beare this infirmity of a man?</p>
            <p>To the knowledge of the firſtenquiry, know that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of man is double.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
               </label> 1. One ſinfull. What are all thoſe ſlips, frailties, imperfections, unwilling riſings, and actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling the godly in their progreſſe of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? are they not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities? and it cannot be denied but that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſuch kinde of infirmities, the ſpirit of a Chriſtian is, and will be ſuſtaining; So long as a man alloweth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in evill, or evill in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27100:7"/> himſelfe; but can and doth thoroughly judge himſelfe unto the bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and loathing, and leaving of all knowne evill; in this caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and his ſtay, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a good eſtate with God againſt all thoſe troubling argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and diſtreſſing feares where withall hee is daily followed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another is ſorrowfull: humane calamity is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity; take all thoſe miſeries and croſſes which divine providence doth inflict either immediately, or mediately upon men, ſuppoſe them to lie in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27100:7"/> the goods, names, bodies, children, or friends of men. And this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of man ſpoken of in this Text; its no new thing for the Holy Ghoſt to call croſſes and afflictions befalling men, by the name of infirmity or weakneſſe, and that becauſe of that naturall imbecillity which is found in man to free himſelfe from them, or to ſtand under them; a ſtate of calamity is a weakning eſtate; and none are more weake then men under the croſſe and rod, theſe things doe make men feeble and infirme; as ſickneſſe is the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the body, ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27100:8"/> croſſes, reproaches, and afflictions are the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man.</p>
            <p>Concerning our ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie, you muſt note that there is a double Spirit ſuſtaining hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One above man, and yet<note place="margin">A two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> given unto man, and that is the Spirit of God, who is a Spirit of power, and doth helpe to beare up the burden of all our calamities; <hi>likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 26. when a Chriſtian doth finde a weakneſſe in himſelfe, both to doe and to ſuffer; the Spirit of God is aſſiſtant unto him, and doth make the burden eaſie and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and what we are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27100:8"/> never able to beare of our ſelves, by his ſtrength we can and ſhall beare it, as the Apoſtle ſhe weth, ſaying, <hi>I can do all things through him that ſtrengthneth me, Phil.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another in man, which maketh man to be man; which in ſome places is<note place="margin">The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man diverſly taken.</note> taken largely for the whole ſoule of man; but in this place more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and ſtrictly for the conſcience of man, its uſuall for the Hebrewes to expreſſe conſcience under the name of the ſpirit or the heart of man; and in the New Teſtament, it is called in one place our ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27100:9"/> place the ſpirit of man; <hi>for what man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of a man, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſpirit of a man which is in him, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 11. and ſurely if we doe<note place="margin">Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and vvhy.</note> looke unto the originall, and being, and manner of working of conſcience in man, which is every way ſpirituall, it is moſt aptly named ſpirit, and this is the ſpirit which is ſo able to ſuſtaine a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his infirmities.</p>

            <p>And ſurely in theſe and the like times, the ſpirit within him which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies retaineth ſtrength and might, may not be ſo ſerviceable and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto him as at other times it hath beene, and in time to come it may be againe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That though there may be much fainting over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the ſpirits of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified men for a time, yet it is not totall faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; there is and may be a very weake uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the ſpirit is many

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27100:23"/> under his infirmity more then another; yea and the ſpirit of the ſame man may at one time and in one croſſe more beare him out then in another. Witneſſe <hi>David,</hi> who in the caſe of <hi>Nabal</hi> was very weake and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate; he had ſcarce the ſpirit of a man in him. But now in the caſe of <hi>Shimei</hi> where the croſſe was farre greater, his ſpirit did with much ſtrength beare him out.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there is a double ſinking of the ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afflictions, or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable evills.</p>

            <p>And thus the godly may faint in part, but they ſhall come to a recovery of themſelves againe; it is with the godly in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings under afflictions, as with a man that is skilfull to ſwimme; at the firſt when hee is caſt into the water he is over head and eares, and the whole body is covered, but by and by hee riſeth up againe and ſwimmes upon the water, commanding the water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; whereas it is with a meere naturall and carnall

            <p>There goeth to the making of the wounded ſpirit theſe things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Miſerable, and in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, helliſh evills; I ſay that innumerable evills doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the ſoule; it is not one miſery, but an army which doth at this time follow a man; <hi>thou reneweſt thy plagues againſt me, and thou increaſeſt thy wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p n="3">3. The manner of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of thoſe miſerable evills, which is every way moſt grievous; for</p>
            <p>Firſt of all it is with much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroſſe of foule; the ſoule is thereby filled with unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.</note> anguiſh and paine, it is as it were put upon the rack, and putto torture and torment in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; <hi>my ſoule is ſoretroubled</hi>

            <p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there is no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing which can relieve a wounded ſpirit, it is not all the gold of the Indies, nor all the favour of Princes, nor all the friends on earth that can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage or cure this wound; a troubled mind impaireth health, drieth up the blood, waſteth the marrow, pines away the fleſh, conſumes the bones, and makes all pleaſures painefull to a man; nothing doth comfort it, but terrifie it; the light doth not comfort him, would God ſaith he it were night; the darkneſſe doth ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie

            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:27100:59"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the ſpirit under its wounds retaineth the ſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of unpardoned guilt, which of all things is moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and makes the ſoule moſt comfortleſſe; when a man ſhall apprehend his ſins to bee unpardonable, or unpardoned, it keepes him in a perpetuall rowling and boyling, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that can no way be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for ſin lieth ſtill at the doore haunting and vexing a man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, a ſpirit that is wounded hath to deale with the mighty and irreſiſtible power of God; Now the ſtrength of any burden is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength of him with whom wee have to deale; under the wound of conſcience God is following his owne cauſe with his owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:27100:60"/> and hee is now aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the wrong that is done to his mercy and patience, and is it poſſible for the creature to ſuſtaine it ſelfe? can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin any enabling againſt Gods preſſure and power? a man while he is to deale with men may beare up himſelfe, and hee may have much ſtrength of wit or impudencie of face to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face all enquiries, but when men are to deale with an all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and an all knowing, and an all-ſinne revenging God, the might of whoſe glory is able to confound men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, if he once ſhall ſtart up our guilts, and breake into our ſoules; if he ſend a trembling heart, and ſorrowfull mind, if himſelfe be witneſſe againſt us, and by his power impriſon and ſhut us up, we cannot avoid it,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27100:60"/> or beare it; time will not eaſe us, company will not eaſe us, peace will not eaſe us, when he wounds none can heale but himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the wound of the ſpirit is accompanied with the accuſations of conſcience; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot be bribed or put of, there is no flying from it; the ſtrength of conſcience is awakened, and her cruelty roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, conſcience under woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth arraigne, evidence, condemne, and bind over unto eternall wrath for ſin; and it is of an indefatigable, unreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unavoidable power in working, a man by flight, or death, or friends, may eſcape the Magiſtrates hand, but by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he poſſibly ever eſcape from a diſpleaſed conſcience, a tormented conſcience cannot
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27100:61"/> flie from God, nor can a man flie from it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, the wound of ſpirit is of an eternall nature, all other wounds end in death, and are therefore the more tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe they be temporall; but this wound endeth not in death, if it be not gratiouſly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is the beginning of hell upon earth unto the wicked, and it continues him in hell upon earth, and after death, it is that worme which ſtill is gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and never dying; death is not the end of this miſery, and this maketh it the more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be borne, what heart can poſſibly ſuſtaine it ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der infinite and endleſſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly and laſtly, when and whilſt men are under the wounds of conſcience, Satan is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27100:61"/> ſtrongly and ſubtly working; ſuch is Satans cowardize that he takes us at the weakeſt, and ſuch is his malice that hee will yet weaken us wee being weakened already; Satan falling in with the bruiſings and ſores of mens ſoules, and bringing in the fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting gall of hell, and powring forth the ſharpeſt vinegar of moſt violent objections, the ſoule tortured and the wound enlarged, and conſcience over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; Satan now tells the ſinner of the impoſſibility of mercy, and uncapableneſſe of the bloud of Chriſt, hee now followeth him with ſtrange endictments, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and concluſions, yea and arguments of inſincerity and hypocriſie, and this adds to the weight and maketh the burden intollerable; there is no ſuch
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:27100:62"/> trouble as to be daily troubled with the divell.</p>
            <p>Having thus opened the wound unto you, and its burden, I ſhall fall upon the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both, in this manner:</p>

            <p n="2">2. That what ever vaine men judge; melancholy is not a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27100:64"/> maladie, or the wounder ſpirit here ſpoken of; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly is not the wounded ſpirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by 5. reaſons.</note> betweene both is great; as</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="3">3. In the cure of it; phyſick may cure the one, it being a bodily diſeaſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; but it is not all artificiall and naturall meanes that can cure the wounds of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the effects of it; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy maketh a man ſimple and abſurd in his thoughts touching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; ſuch men will ſpeake to you and yet conceive themſelves to bee without head or

            <p n="5">5. In the enlargement of it; melancholy ſeldome or never worketh griefe for Gods diſhonour; it is not touched with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin, and when it is cured, it gives not a man any ground and meaſure of ſpirituall joy; it enforceth not a man to Chriſt for eaſe and reſt; it quickens no man to prayer and duty;

            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, let us know our ſelves rightly in our troubles of mind, and we ſhall the better know our ſelves in our comforts; nothing doth ſo prepare the heart for comforts, and make us to relliſh our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts as the ſenſe of ſoule trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heavineſſe: I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that if wee did know and finde our ſpirituall wants and wounds more, wee would and ſhould withall bee more upon the waies and feelings of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then we are.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Make no adventures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſin; for a man to make light of the leaſt ſin, and impudently or improvidently to hazard his ſoule upon the occaſions of ſin, is the readie way to wound the ſpirit: there are too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who out of a ſecret confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their ſelfe mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doe object their ſoules upon ſinfull companies; they doe as many men that goe out of their houſes well and ſound, but home they are brought all gored and wounded; in like manner, ſinfull occaſions have the advantage of us and will ſoone wound us, let us not proudly preſume of our owne
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:27100:69"/> ſtrength, 'tis not the largeneſſe of our judgements, or fullneſſe of our graces, or the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſſe of our reſolutions that can keepe us (preſuming) from foiles and wounds by ſin; ſuch as make nothing of ſin ſhall ſoone bee wounded and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Seeke not outward plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures too much; exceſſe of pleaſures breed exceſſive trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings and ſadneſſe of ſpirit; ſuch men do pierce themſelves thorough and thorough with many ſorrowes who doe affect a way of worldly delight, and will take their fill of pleaſures; who ſo will have the Bee muſt have his ſting alſo, and if wee will laugh and bee merry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, wee ſhall lie downe and howle for vexation of ſpirit; doe not ſo vainely
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:27100:70"/> bathe your ſelves in carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and worldly recreations; the worldlings paſtime is the deadneſſe and wound of a Chriſtians conſeience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beware of formality and remiſſeneſſe in holy ſervices: the Ordinances not rightly uſed doe wound exceedingly; how vexing is the word to a formall and carnall Chriſtian? did any man fall of, grow cold, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to dead his heart to the meanes and duties, but his heart at the laſt was greatly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it; the neglect of Chriſt by the Church, when his voice did ſeeme unſeaſonable and inopportune unto her, was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by her ſpirituall woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nouriſh no hypocriſie or guile within you, doe not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſin with faire pretences,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27100:70"/> and plaiſter over a foule heart with an outſide profeſſion, ſerve not graven images when you pretend a ſervice unto God, if you doe ſo, know that it will feſter to a ſore, and make ſuch a wound, which will proove the great diſquietment of your ſoules; Satan would have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened this hypocriſie on <hi>Iob,</hi> to have aggravated his miſery; and he well knoweth that hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is wounding.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Goe not on in ſinnefull waies againſt generall or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular convictions; there are who have ſuch abundance of love to ſin in them, that they will be wicked againſt the light of knowledge and the dictate of conſcience, it is not the knowledge they have of evill, nor the riſngs up and reproofes of conſcience within them for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:27100:71"/> evills which can hold them of from evill; but on they goe, and wickedly they will doe, now as this prooves an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, ſo it maketh the wound very deepe; if know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience hold us not of from ſin, it will hold on ſin, peircing the marrow, and vitals of the ſpirit; <hi>David</hi> went againſt as great light as any man did, and did not his ſins proove wounding ſins, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his bones and heart? and ſo will thine too.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Keepe your ſelves in the waies of duty, walking in every action according to the rule, and peace ſhall be upon your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. I ſay the more holy and unblameable a man is, the more ſtrict a man is with himſelfe in keeping himſelfe under the law of religion, the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27100:71"/> more aſſured peace and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall he finde within his conſcience; <hi>The waies of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are waies of pleaſantneſſe, and all her paths are peace, yea and the keeping of ſound wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion ſhall be life unto our ſoules, Prov.</hi> 3. 17, 21, 22. I aſſure you that duties conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, ſincerely, and conſtantly performed, doe keepe up the ſoule in life and joy.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>5</label> Fiftly, continue not your ſelves under the wounds of conſcience; there is a ſtrange cruelty which Gods children doe offer unto themſelves, in keeping the wound upon the ſoule alwaies freſh and blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; whereby they lie lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<note place="margin">Men doe continue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſpirituall vvounds ſix vvaies</note> under it then they need to doe; I ſhall touch upon the waies and grounds of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wound of conſcience on a mans ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:27100:72"/>1. Want of ſeaſonable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and comfort; when men do hide their wounded eſtate, and will not repaire to appointed comforts and comforters, this doth not onely enlarge the wound, but ſettle it; as wee ſee in bodily wounds, if they want a timely looking too, it is the longer before that they heale; the caſe is ſo here, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies breed dangers: and we are ſpeedily to make in to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, do not ſleight the leaſt wound as many doe, who at the firſt make nothing of it; but ſet upon the cure as ſoone as you eſpie the wound; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is prepared before hand, and phyſitians to apply it are at hand, onely take you heed of a ſinfull baſhfullneſſe, and dumbe divell, and curſed negligence, cry not out when it is too late.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:27100:72"/>2. Recourſe unto contrary medicines; there are many falſe and deluding medicines unto conſcience; and there are many medicines which are vertuall, but yet not ſutable, all medicines heale not all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; wee ſee in experience in bodily wounds which are but ſmall and little to looke to, if that a contrary medicine bee applied to it, it doth enrage it, and increaſe it, and continue it many times unto the death of the patient; and thus if men in and under their ſpirituall wounds will runne to the uſe of ſuch druggs and playſters which may onely for a time damme up the ſenſe, but not make upthe wound, they may long and long continue under the wound, and cry out of their wounds; you may no more
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27100:73"/> think to heale the ſpirit by ſin, then by adding piles of wood <label type="milestone">

            <p n="3">3. Illneſſe of diet; diet is much in continuing of bodily wounds; there are meates and drinkes which men muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from, if that they intend to be cured: and 'tis as true in the ſpirituall Surgerie; if that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27100:73"/> wee enlarge our deſires after for bidden fruit, and delight to feed upon ſinfull husks, and will be doing that we ſhould not, we may thanke our ſelves for the ſmart of our wounds; is it the way to be rid of a wound to vexe it? and to feed contrary to it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Selfe-niceneſſe; men are many times ſo tender and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent toward themſelves, that they will be healed onely by ſoft words, and the covering of a faire cloth, they will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves unto the paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſearchings of the Law; but they are in this cruell to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and out of ſelfe favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring do make their miſery lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and longer.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The life of ſenſe; which is open to all winds, and the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping open of all wounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27100:74"/> the ſoule, my meaning is this; that when Chriſtians do place the diſpoſition of God towards them, and judge of themſelves according to the condition of their own feelings and ſenſible apprehenſions; this is that which doth greatly keepe up the wound of the ſpirit; for now the ſoule being under its ebbings, and finding the channell in a manner drie, ſo as he cannot ſee what he was wont to behold; begins thus to reaſon, ſurely God is not my God in grace and mercy, for I cannot finde him in his love to me as I was wont to doe; which condition is full of ſuſpenſe and feare and doubting, and muſt needs continue the wound.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Harkning unto Satan; if a man doe beleeve the divels teſtimony and information tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27100:74"/> his eſtate and condition, and take up all his ſpeech up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt for truth, he ſhall keepe himſelfe in bleeding wounds, the more Satan doth tamper with our condition, and take upon him to judge of our ſins, and ſervices, and temper and ſtanding, the more ſad and doubtfull will our condition be. I ſay if wee ſhall put the iſſue of our condition upon the determination of Satan, and all his interpretations and deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall bee goſpell with us, Lord how ſhall wee bee toſſed too and fro? and where there is no reſt, how can there bee the healing of the wound?</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that the leaſt degree of faith within the ſoule of a man, though accompanied with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many doubtings, doth denominate Chriſtians belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with God, <hi>Peters</hi> doubting did not put him out of the ranke of beleevers; Chriſt doth not ſay to him, O thou of doubting, thy faith is little; but hee<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 31.</note> gives him this title, <hi>O' thou of little faith;</hi> God judgeth of his according to their better part, and if hee finde a little grace among many corruptions, hee calls us according unto the grace.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, there muſt bee care taken to diſtinguiſh doubtings
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:27100:110"/> in Chriſtians from doubtings that are found in unregenerate men; moſt true it is, that the ſame diſeaſe of doubting is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto good and bad, it is corruption in both, it being a ſinne for any to doubt; yet it is as true, that doubting ſtands differingly in the godly from the wicked in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the godly there is doubting againſt a temper and frame directly oppoſite unto doubtings; doubtings in them doe hold an oppoſition againſt faith and perſwaſion wrought in the ſoule; faith in nature and<note place="margin">Doubting a nature and an infirmity.</note> act is oppoſite to doubting in nature and act; they have two ſprings or cauſes in the ſoule of man; it is impoſſible that the doubtings of the godly ſhould ſpring from their ſpirituall
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:27100:110"/> frame and temper; grace doth not begin or cheriſh doubtings in any, it forbids to doubt and commands to beleeve; it grieves at doubting and thirſts after ſetling, ſo that they ſtand as infirmities in the godly, not as a nature; in unregenerate men doubtings are a nature and of their entire conſtitution; doubtings are begotten and bred up in them by a nature that is wholy ſinnefull and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the godly doubtings are ſubdued in their power, by reaſon of converſion and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, wherein this as well as all other ſinnes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it deaths wounds; the life and trouble of doubts onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine<note place="margin">Doubtin in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</note> in the godly, interrupting them in the great worke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, for were not faith
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:27100:111"/> aſſaulted by the ſtirrings of doubtings within, it would doe its part moſt gloriouſly, but now as a man that hath a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med leg cannot moove as hee deſires, no more can Chriſtians beleeve as they would, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of doubtings which doe croſſe them; but this is all that doubtings can doe in the godly, they can moleſt, but never command; their powers are cruſhed, and faith riſeth up victoriouſly over all at the laſt; now in wicked men doubtings raigne and have ſoveraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the godly doubtings are partiall; it is of the ſubject, not of the object, in action, not<note place="margin">Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings 1. Partiall. 2. Entire.</note> affection, of evidence, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herance, of the circumſtantialls, not ſubſtantialls; it is thus with Chriſtians, that though in many

               <p n="4">4. In the godly doubtings turne unto their profit, God for very good ends doth ſuffer<note place="margin">Ends of doubtings in the godly foure.</note> doubtings in his, as 1. To free them from many ſins of pride, preſumption, negligence and the like: 2. To force them to their divine helps, that now they may the more enquire and ſeeke reſolution and ſetling from Heaven. 3. To make them more firme and certaine <label type="milestone">

               <p n="5">5. In the Elect all doubtings are curable and recoverable, they are poſſible of cure, and ſhall actually be cured in Gods time by Gods meanes; the Lord doth mercifully heale his of all the toſſings and turnings of their minds, that at length they come to reſt upon the mountaine of his truth &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto them in Chriſt; there is an excellent temper toward <label type="milestone">

To relieve the ſoule in this caſe, I ſhall propound theſe few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if unworthineſſe were a ſufficient ground to keepe men of from divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and eternall happineſſe, none of all the ſonnes of men could ever bee ſaved, for all have ſinned, and by ſinne made themſelves unworthy of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective worthineſſe antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required unto juſtification and ſalvation; God well knew the unworthy condition of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when hee made them his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:27100:123"/> people, entering into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life and peace with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there was any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent worthineſſe in them that did lie weltring in their owne blood? beggars are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of almes, traitors are not worthy of pardons, nor ſinfull men worthy of Chriſt or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 21. and why ſhould we dreame of having a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite worthineſſe of our owne? if man had any thing in him, he were altogether unfit to come in unto the free offer of grace; we ſee the invitation is made to the monie-leſſe and merit-leſſe Chriſtian, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That though worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be not in the ſtreame, yet it is in the fountain; and though there bee no ſubjective worthineſſe in men, yet there is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:27100:124"/> an objective worthineſſe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, which is tendred to ſinners by grace, and accepted by faith; there is enough in Chriſt to make our perſons lovely and acceptable to God, without whom, if we had all ſelfe-worthineſſe, wee ſhould remaine in Gods eyes moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy perſons; <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> ſaith the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Mercy in God is full and free, it hath enough in it ſelfe to incline it ſelfe to gratious pardons, and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptances; God doth blot out tranſgreſſions, not for
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:27100:124"/> mans ſake, but for his owne ſake, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43. 25.</p>
               <p>Secondly, mans chiefeſt ſelfe-worthineſſe is to ſee his owne unworthineſſe, and to be humbled for it; certainely, ſuch<note place="margin">Eſa. 64. 6. Luk. 15. 21.</note> as have baſe &amp; low eſteemes of themſelves, and can dwell upon the guilt and merit of their owne ſinnefullneſſe, judging themſelves to hell for it; ſuch<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7.</note> as can (with <hi>Paul</hi>) diſclaime from all worth in themſelves, and doe ſee in all their parts, and gifts, and performances an inability to engratiate them with God; ſuch as can in the beſt of conditions, and after the beſt of performances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile their weake expreſſions of duty, acknowledging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be moſt unprofitable<note place="margin">Luk 17. 10.</note> ſervants, needing the mercy of a God and the merit of Chriſt;

               <p>Thirdly, an unworthy ſinner may plead out the Covenant of grace with God, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the tenders of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; I know no man that can or doth more admire and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie divine mercy, then a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner truly ſenſible of his owne unworthineſſe; I know none more deſirous of mercy then ſuch; I know none will be more ready to accept of Heaven and favour out of freeneſſe of grace then ſuch; I know none to whom the offer of ſalvation purchaſed by Chriſt is made but ſuch; and what now doth hinder them from comming in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:27100:125"/> unto God, pleading with him after this or the like manner. Gratious Lord, I am here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee for mercy, and for thy Chriſt, I ſee in my ſelfe nothing worthy thee or thy Chriſt; for I am wholy ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; if thou now wilt receive mee for thine owne, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mee my ſinnes out of thine owne free grace, and for the merit of thine onely Sonne alone, thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelfe a gratious God indeed; O Lord that which draweth mee in unto thee for grace, is thine owne free grace; thou gaveſt mee the word and hope of comfort, and therefore I durſt not ſtand out; Lord, loe heere I am before thee, without all confidence in my ſelfe; O let it be unto mee according to the freeneſſe and richneſſe of thy
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:27100:126"/> mercy, refuſe mee not though I am unworthy to be called thy ſonne.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="1">1. That a little grace is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then no grace; it is the want of grace that is damnable, and may cauſe a man to cloſe up againſt himſelfe all aſſurance and ſettlement; tell mee O Chriſtian, wouldſt thou change thy poore condition in grace for the greateſt graceleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the world? wilt thou part from that grace thou haſt

               <p n="2">2. That a little grace requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a great deale of thankes, it comming from the God of all grace and being an argument of ſound ſanctification; ſhall I ſay that it is not the way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe to make little of any divine mercie; we are too little for the leaſt meaſure by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our unworthineſſe; and we doe not well to undervalew the leaſt proportion and gift of grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which one man makes little unto himſelfe, would bee a great deale with many other Chriſtians; wee
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:27100:130"/> finde in experience, that the rich mans complaint would be the poore mans content; many poore ſoules could well feaſt themſelves with the fragments that come from their tables, when as they doe fooliſhly and proudly complain of want; juſt ſo it is with many Chriſtians, they tell us that grace is weake and ſmall in them, when other Chriſtians reaſoning with them, and hearing them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, doe bleſſe God for their eſtate in grace, and would bee exceeding glad were they in their condition of grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That men of no grace are never troubled and truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about ſmallneſſe and weakeneſſe of grace, the eyes of ſuch are not yet opened to ſee their ſpirituall wants.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That little grace is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:27100:130"/> of grace in the ſoule; a little man is a man, and a little faith is faith; grace in truth hath a being in weakeneſſe it ſelfe, and though it bee in the loweſt meaſures, there the ſoule hath an intereſt in God, in Chriſt, in the promiſes and in heaven, little faith can and doth lay hold of great things, and prooves unto Chriſtians a great aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Little grace is a creature of God which he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe or forſake; <hi>Doth God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe</hi>

                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:27100:131"/>7. Little grace will doe much, it many times doth that in and for Chriſtians under weakeneſſe that all the world cannot doe for them, it is their light in darkneſſe, their life in death, and their upholdment from ſinking; the widdowes little oile and little meale went a great way, God bleſſing it; and thus it is with little grace, it will carry a man thorough the whole world and doe mighty things for him; the great advantages of a little grace is unſpeakable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That grace in weakneſſe is made for ſtrength, and grace in littleneſſe is fitted for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, our graces paſſe from imperfection to perfection, and from weakeneſſe unto ſtrength; Gods ſtrength being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> in mans weakneſſe; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:27100:131"/> doth both call in and ſet out the glory of divine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: conſider, that he who hath moſt grace hath not all he ſhould have, and hee who hath leaſt in grace hath not all that he would have, both meaſures are riſing up unto greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; little grace is in a ſtate of growth, and in and by the uſe of meanes it is enlarged, as we may ſee in <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and all new borne Chriſtians, whoſe growth is much in parts and powers of their graces: they have riſen from ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to moſt admirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That gifts of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and appertaining unto mens ſalvation are different and unequall, grace is alike in nature, but not alike in meaſure in all; the different ſtandings

               <p>I anſwer, not from nullity and falſeneſſe of grace, as weake Chriſtians do ſurmiſe; but</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the wiſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, who giveth grace to every man according to his owne good will and pleaſure, and followeth his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with the ſame proportion of aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the variety of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions; every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath not alike forcible oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exerciſe his graces gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him.</p>

               <p n="4">4. From the variety of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aſſiſtance; every man hath not at all times an equall gale or breath of the Spirit to enlighten, affect, excite, and draw them onward.</p>

               <p n="6">6. From the ſinfullneſſe and careleſneſſe of ſome Chriſtians above others, when as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the conceit of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of their graces, they doe ſwell with pride, when they cannot bee thankfull for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and abilities formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when their imaginations
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:27100:134"/> are meane of graces beſtowed, they thinking that they will not ſerve turne to their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in a word, when they are inconſtant in duties and doe not ſtirre up the graces in them, wiſely watching the motions of the Spirit, and improoving the ſeaſons of grace; this is the thing which occaſioneth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality ſpoken of.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That no man miſſeth of Heaven for want of meaſures, but for want of the truth of grace, I grant a Chriſtians conſolation lieth much in the comparative degree, but his ſalvation is in the poſitive degree of grace, though one Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cannot beleeve as ſtrongly as another, yet beleeving hee ſhall bee ſaved as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; littleneſſe and greatneſſe of grace doe agree in ſaving

               <p>To the releevement of the ſoule under this burden, I ſhall<note place="margin">Five ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in duties.</note> yeeld you theſe meditations following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the beſt of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have beene, are, and may bee indiſpoſed in holy duties; though the ſpirit of <hi>Peter</hi> bee willing, yet the fleſh was weake,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 41.</note> and there being contrary
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:27100:136"/> luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit, a Chriſtian cannot doe the things he would; O how doth fleſh clog and dull the beſt of Gods Saints? there is within them a living ſpring without a lively operation; the ſpring I ſay is open, but the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration narrow, ſo as it is with them in the manner of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming duties, as it is with a ſicke man, hee would faine <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> walke a turne about his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but alas hee cannot doe it his body is ſo weake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a wide difference betweene a heart that is dead unto duty, and a dull and indiſpoſed heart in duty; a dead heart wants a living ſpring and is contrary unto all duty; as it falls off from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo it gives it ſelfe an allowance and diſpenſation in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:27100:136"/> the ſame, and can and doth find no trouble within it ſelfe under all <hi>non</hi>-performances of duties; whereas a Chriſtian under all his uneveneſſe in duties, hath an inward intention and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto duties, ſuch men in their dulleſt times and greateſt indiſpoſitions ſee not more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then they would doe, and are grieved becauſe they cannot doe duties in a more lively and ſpirituall manner; ſuch ſtand up from the dead and are ready for divine emploiment; there is a praying ſpirit in them; ſo as they can ſay with <hi>Paul, the good</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that I would I doe not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two evidences when the bent of a mans heart is for duties in a living and right way.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when a heavie kinde of performing duties is diſpleaſing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:27100:137"/> and contrary unto the frame of the ſoule and ſpirit of a man; ſuch men ſet upon duties ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully, and performe duties with feare, and riſe from duties humbled, greatly blaming themſelves for the heavineſſe and diſtraction of ſpirit which they obſerve to bee in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the deſires are riſing out of the ſtate of indiſpoſition, ſuch men eaſily faſten upon the waies of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and bettering themſelves in duty, expecting that they may be ſhaken out of their fits of dullneſſe: I dare ſay that ſuch men will reade the more, and pray the more, and heare the more, hoping to finde ſome helpe in the uſe of the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and performances of duties, they have heard and doe find it
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:27100:137"/> to bee true, that frequencie in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> duty begets fervencie, that as a man by often rubbing of his benummed parts may get heate, ſo a Chriſtian by forcing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the going over of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doth get ſtrength againſt his dullneſſe in duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when a Chriſtian cannot doe duties with that life he ſhould and would doe, yet hee may doe them with much ſincerity and uprightneſſe of heart, and in a farre different way from a formall and carnall Chriſtian; I yeeld unto this, that an hypocrite who hath a name to live may talke much of duty and may mount high into the viſible duties of holineſſe, applying himſelfe to many reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious actions; the Jewes were not failing in their ſervices and ſacrifices, and ſolemne aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:27100:138"/> but yet they came ſhort of ſincerity, and ſo all was loſt labour unto them.</p>
               <p>You may aske mee what is<note place="margin">Seven dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferences betvveene an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties</note> the difference betwixt an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and a ſincere Chriſtian in doing duties?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it is much every way; which may bee ſeene in ſeven things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Chriſtian doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all duties by the power of ſpirituall life wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his ſoule, he praieth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, and reades, and heares in the Spirit by vertue of the working of the Spirit; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life in the ſoule is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to it ſelfe to act required du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it needs not altogether thoſe naturall and accidentall helpes which falſe Chriſtians muſt have to ſet them on work; the bird flies in the aire from a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:27100:138"/> principle of life and motion in himſelfe, whereas a clock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> a dead thing mooveth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the weights are powerfull to the wheeles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a Chriſtian is more generall or univerſall in the performance of duties then any hypocrite can be; he ſets himſelfe to duties of every kinde, even thoſe of the higheſt nature and excellencie; duties required admit of a diſtinction, there are the greater and the leſſer things of the Law; there are ſome duties which ſtrike at the quick and call for ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſuch as are ſelfe-deniall ſinnes-mortification, the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of God in a mans thoughts, deſires, and ſpeeches in all the conditions of life; ſome duties there are which are exceeding high and climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:27100:139"/> as beleeving in God and in Chriſt, and keeping the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there are ordinary and extraordinary duties, publique and private duties, coſtly and painefull duties, and all theſe the ſpirit of ſoundneſſe is for, Chriſtians are ready to act all as well as one duty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; looke which way duty (whoſe latitude is much, and parts many) divides it ſelfe, thither they diſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that as water will runne in all prepared channels, ſo a Chriſtian followeth all requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red duties, whereas hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie doth duties with partiality and delicacie, it ſevers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides duties, it will bee upon this, but not on that duty, and is neither whole nor lively in any duty; and no marvaile, for as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:27100:139"/> waters cannot riſe higher then <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> their ſprings, no more can an hypocrite riſe higher then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a Chriſtian doth act ſpirituall duties ſpiritually, in the purpoſe and reſolution of his heart hee doth empty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of fleſh and corruption (which will bee creeping into duty) as much as may be; ſuch an one undertakes no duty, but with ſelfe-examination and ſoule-humiliation for ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and remaining within, ſuch follow the Law of the ſpirit, exerciſing all vouchſafed graces in the performance of duties; Chriſtians indeed doe heare and pray with much knowledge, faith, feare, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by reaſon of the performance of the duty they become more ſpirituall;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:27100:140"/> I ſay a Chriſtian in duty is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man from what hee is at other times, ſuch heavenly raptures and ſoule-raviſhments doe befall him, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he feeles no world, no place, no time; whereas a formall Chriſtian is a baſe and mixt mettall, formality leades him into duties carnall, keepes him in duties carnall, and brings him off from duties not onely carnall, but much more ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and prophane then hee was before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a Chriſtian doth performe duties encreaſingly; his deſires are ſuch and ſo great unto duty, that he cannot give himſelfe any ſatisfaction in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties; his ſpirit within him is like unto leaven which is of a riſing nature, or to the graine of muſtard ſeed which
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:27100:140"/> was of a ſpreading nature; the ſoule wil be carried with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire of bettering it ſelfe in duty, and performing more and more duty unto God, nay it riſeth in duty againſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as a living ſpring doth <label type="milestone">

I grant that at the firſt a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is and may be little and low in duty, but at length an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will follow anſwerable to the life beſtowed and duties to be performed; <hi>Davids</hi> ſpring at ſometimes did but drop
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:27100:141"/> gently, at other times it did run freely and fully, whereas the hypocrite keepes him in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or compaſſe, he is confined and limited, and is much like unto artificiall bodies uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of extenſion; reſtings and ſufficits overtake ſuch men, and if there be any ſwellings in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is not from an incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principle of grace which is within as a feeding ſpring, but from ſome externall reaſon and influence; there may bee the riſing of waters in a pond by <label type="milestone">

               <p>Fifthly, a Chriſtian exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe in ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties chearefully, ſuch doe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:27100:141"/> actions pleaſingly, as with willingneſſe of heart, ſo with gladneſſe of heart; it is meate and drinke and recreation unto them to performe ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Exod. 35. 29. Pſal. 100. 2. Pſal. 110. verſ. 3. Epheſ.</hi> 6. 5, 6. whereas hypocriſie is of a Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh nature, ſlow to the duty; it is mooved, it mooves not it ſelfe; to a formall heart 1. Spirituall duties are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and tedious, and though ſomething bee done, yet it is with ſecret wearineſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancie, and unwillingneſſe, there are many objections rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up againſt duties, and many caſes and queſtions which muſt be anſwered and reſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch can ſet on to duty. 2. The cloſing up of ſpirituall duties is very pleaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, the Lord knoweth
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:27100:142"/> that as in his heart hee wiſheth there were no time nor duties belonging to God, ſo hee is glad of a ſuddaine releaſe from all duties, the ſhorter the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and the ſhorter the prayers the more pleaſing, ſuch is the incongruity of ſpirituall ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with carnall hearts, and if that any joy and delight bee in them at all, it is but falſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, a Chriſtian doth performe duties conſtantly; ſuch men have everlaſting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in ſerving God, and though there may be pawſes and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ceſſations by reaſon of ſome intervenient accidents, yet a totall and finall ceſſation in duty cannot overtake Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; grace in truth never dieth unto duty, but holds out unto the very laſt in beleeving,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:27100:142"/> obeying, and praying, whereas an hypocrite according to his falſe and vaniſhing principles is mutable and inconſtant in duty; according to that ſpeech, <hi>Will</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 27. 10</note> 
                  <hi>the hypocrite delight himſelfe in the Almighty?</hi> will hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies call upon God? ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee may doe it, but at all times he neither can nor will pray.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, a Chriſtian doth act all required duties diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wiſely; I meane with the obſervation of the rules and requiſites and methods which wiſedome it ſelfe doth declare unto men in and for the performance of duties; ſuch will principally doe thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are ſutable and proper to themſelves and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their relations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and that within their
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:27100:143"/> owne orbe, whereas hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie wanders from its owne neſt, and doth prey abroad in other mens families, but not at home in their owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; ſuch will manage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mooving on-ward in a juſt proportion; they ſpend not all the time in duties of faith, and duties of charity alone, but ſo doe one act of godlineſſe that they may doe another alſo, one buſineſſe doth not put by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, as it doth with hypocrites, who in doing of ſome duties hinder themſelves in other; in a word, ſuch are ſeaſonable in doing duties; though no time bee unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Chriſtian duties, yet all duties muſt not bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all times; Chriſtians muſt heare when God requires them to heare, and pray when
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:27100:143"/> God requireth them to pray,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 3.</note> they muſt bring forth all their fruit in the ſeaſon of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſervice of hypocriſie is fruit out of ſeaſon, ſuch as are formall will bee comming to Church when others are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Church, they will pray when they ſhould heare, and reade when they ſhould pray, which maketh their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the ſacrifice of fooles, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in the doing of Chriſtian duties the bent of the heart is both obſerved and accepted of God; you cannot forget the counſell of <hi>David</hi> unto <hi>Salomon, Know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a</hi>

               <p>Spirituall thoughts are thoſe<note place="margin">2. Spiritual</note>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:27100:166"/> motions and turnings of the minde, flowing from the work of grace in the ſoule, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining themſelves in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and ſupernaturall objects; there are two things which doe conſtitute the ſpirituallneſſe of mans thoughts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The originall cauſe of them; namely their ſpringing from a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied fountaine that is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within the ſoule, the mind muſt bee renewed and ſanctified, altered, and cleanſed, ere it can and doth yeeld out holy inclinations, and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and have within it holy projects, counſells, imaginations and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpeciall object of them; the thoughts

               <p>Theſe kinde of thoughts are peculiar unto Gods Saints after regeneration, <hi>for without the Spirit no man is able to thinke one good thought, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 5. as for wicked men if wee conſider their thoughts formerly they are ſtarke naught; yea and if wee conſider them objectively, they may bee naturally and morally ((<hi>i. e.</hi>) as they moove in the way of nature, and tend to the good of a civill ſtate and countrey) good; but ſpiritually good they are not, they no way further their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and obedience, but
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:27100:167"/> doe occaſion much hardneſſe and ſinfullneſſe unto them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Aſcending thoughts, which flow from the corrupt heart of man; <hi>Out of the heart proceed

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Happily curioſity may here enquire into the juſt difference betweene thoſe ſinfull thoughts which aſcend from mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Satan?</p>
               <p>Certaine it is that there is a reall difference; but for my part I cannot peremptorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it; a Chriſtian may know, that the divell hath beene in his heart and layd his egg there, and ſhuffled in his motion there; but becauſe there is ſuch a
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:27100:168"/> mixture of ſeeds in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinfull thoughts which are monſtrous, and that both of them are like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> brethren in evill, it is to mee a point of great difficulty to determine their apprehenſive difference; yet I reverence thoſe Divines and their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who have given out the probable differences betweene Diabolicall and Naturall thoughts, in their unnaturall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unreaſonableneſſe, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineſſe and unceſſantneſſe, unto whoſe reaſons I leave my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and doe proceed to teach you.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the deareſt children of God beſides their naturall thoughts, may have many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and evill thoughts glancing and riſing up within their<note place="margin">Iob 1. 5.</note>

Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is as watchfull and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt them as any other, and hee doth more fiercely aſſault them then any other, and is more willing to vexe them then any other. 2. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption cleaves to the ſoules of them as well as others, and it workes in them as well as in any other; where the ſpring of corruption is not wholy dried up, it is and will be more or leſſe bubbling out into moſt vile and noiſome thoughts. 3. Infirmity is many times as much in them as it is in others; they are not alwaies ſo watchfull, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as it doth become them; if the windowes ſtand open no wonder if birds flie into the
